## Moore machines
> In automata theory, there are two basic types of finite-state machines (FSM). One of those is called Moore machine , named after its inventor Edward Moore, who introduced the concept in 1956. Moore machines consist of states and transitions. States are able to produce outputs, and the output is determined solely by the current state, not by any input.

This host is going to calculate the status of multiple player. 
For example, a player have two states in a loop: Stand-by, Take Action, and have properties: ATK, STA, HP, AP, BUFF, SKILL
